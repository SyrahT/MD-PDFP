# Multi-consensus decentralized primal-dual fixed point algorithm for distributed learning

This is a demonstration of our algorithm MD-PDFP. The program "'demo.m'" conducts experiments on the two-star network using the Fused Lasso method to illustrate the effects of the parameter $\gamma$. The output of the program, which is depicted in Figure "'demo.m'", corresponds to Figure 3(b) in the paper.
